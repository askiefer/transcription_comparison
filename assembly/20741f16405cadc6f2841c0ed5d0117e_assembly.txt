Good morning, members.
AB Two.
A Two is a simple bill that provides a technical cleanup to the statute which makes it a felony to aid, advise or encourage a suicide.
In 2015, the legislature passed the End of Life Option Act, which allowed a terminally ill adult with the capacity to make medical decisions to request an aid and dying medication if certain conditions are met.
The End of Life Option Act insulates a prescribing physician and a person who is present to assist a qualified patient in preparing the drug from criminal liability for actions which are authorized under the act.
However, when the End of Life Option was enacted, the penal code provision which makes it a crime to aid a suicide was not updated to reflect that change.
This bill makes the necessary changes and specifies that actions which are authorized under the End of Life Option Act cannot be prosecuted under the criminal statute.
