We are at file out of number eleven, AB 310.
Clerk will read Assembly Bill 310 by Assembly Member Medina and actually into community colleges.
Mr.
Medina.
Thank you, Mr.
Speaker and members.
Today I'm pleased to present a B 310.
Over 2 million California community college students rely on a workforce of over 40,000 part time faculty members.
Despite the 25% goal established in Education Code in 1988, 43% of credit classes are being taught by part time faculty.
There is a distinct relationship between after class access to faculty and student success, but information on part time faculty office hours are not reported.
AB 310 will include a reporting requirement on the amount of part time faculty office hours at the district level and require that this information be publicized on the community college district's websites.
AB 310 would also support the goals of the Student Success Act by including the collection of metrics critical for student success.
This bill has received strong bipartisan support and has received no no votes.
I respectfully ask for your I vote.
Thank you, Mr.
Medina.

File item number twelve is a B 427.
Clerk will read Assembly Bill 427 by Assembly Member Mursuchi and others, an actor length to aerospace.
Mr.
Mursuchi.
Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
Members A, B, four, two, seven, creates the California Aerospace and Aviation Commission to provide statewide public private leadership for policy recommendations to the governor and legislature in support of California's iconic aerospace industry.
Aerospace has been for decades one of the leading industries in our state, particularly in Southern California.
The Los Angeles South Bay Area, which I represent, is home to many of the global leaders of innovation companies like SpaceX, Northrop, Boeing, and many others.
They provide hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs, including good paying union jobs.
But this national and global leadership is constantly being threatened by other states that want to lure our aerospace industry from California.
California already has commissions for other industries like the Film Commission and the Travel and Tourism Commission.
However, currently there is no official statewide advocate for the aerospace industry.
We must continue to lead the nation in the aerospace innovation space and to continue to grow good paying jobs in our state.
I respectfully ask for you I vote.
Thank you, Mr.
Marsucci.

This legislation would require the board to establish six counties to receive funding and issue grants in an amount of not less than $300,000 and not more than $2 million.
