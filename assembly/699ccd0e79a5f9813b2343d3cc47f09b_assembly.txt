Madam Chair, we're presenting item 26, SB 1437.
Whenever you and your witness are ready, we may begin.
Thank you so much.
I know we had to take a break.
I wish our other committee members were here, but I know that there's lots of competing committees.
So it is not due to a disinterest, but am presenting SB 1437, which we have titled the Best Practices Act because its purpose is for better and equitable sentencing through thoughtful practices.
Now, what do I mean by that?
California's murder statute has been applied, has over time, been more broad in its application.
And I think that most of us have the perspective that our punishment should fit the crime.
And what's happened over time is that prosecutors have, due to a kind of archaic common law, the Felony Murder Rule, they've been able to replace the intent to commit murder with the intent to commit a felony.
In those situations where a felony results in a death, what does that mean?
That means that a large number of people in California who did not commit murder have been sentenced with first degree murder.
I want to put this more accurately.
They were charged with first degree murder and then sentenced for life without parole.
So a disproportionate long sentences for people who did not actually commit the murder.
And I won't give all the statistics on that, but I will raise one about the women.
In California's state facilities, we have 70.
We have about 182 women.
And I may be off by just a couple that are now serving a life sentence in California.
Of those women, 72% of them did not commit the homicide.
So what SB 1437 does is reserves the harshest punishment for those who intentionally planned or actually committed the murder.
And it establishes a process for resentencing in those cases where the individual can demonstrate that their charge was not proportionate to their participation in the crime.
And here to testify as my witnesses in support are Robert Garcia from the Jesuit Restorative Justice Initiative and Dr.
Wilson from the SF Public Defender's Office.
Okay?
My name is Robert Garcia.
In 1992, I was 16 years of age when I was involved in two street robberies that led to the killing of one man and the serious assault of another man.
That night, I got drunk and high with friends who were also juveniles and a part of the street gang I belonged to.
We decided to go out and rob people.
I was unarmed, but one of my co defendants, then 17 years old, was armed with a folding knife.
When a victim resisted, my co defendants stabbed him.
I later learned that this man had died.
When I found that out, I was horrified.
I had intended to rob, but I never meant that anyone be killed.
I broke down when I learned that a person has lost his life.
I was charged as an adult pled guilty to a first degree murder charge and was sentenced to a term of 26 years to life in State Prison.
I did not understand the Felony Murder Rule at the time.
It was confusing to me that I will be sentenced for a crime that I never agreed to commit and never intended to commit.
The perpetrator of the killing received an indeterminate sentence of 45 years to life in State prison.
I do not excuse my participation in the robberies that night.
My behavior was horrible and had a ripple effect that affected many lives.
I understood that in 1992 when I realized when that had happened, and I know that now.
I was young, immature teenager who was impulsive and failed to appreciate risk and consequences.
My father had left my home to be with another woman who he had impregnated.
My mom was emotionally devastated and for various reasons could not give me the support I needed without guidance.
My peers and I turned to each other for support.
The presentencing report referred to me in terms reserved for an animal called me feral, and the probation report questioned whether I even had a conscience.
I assure you I did have a conscience and I understood the robberies I committed that night deserved punishment.
However, I never intended to kill anyone or to afflict lifelong suffering on others where not for the Felony Murder Rule, I would have received a sentence of over eleven years in State prison for my conduct that night.
However, because of the Felony Murder Rule, even though I did not kill nor intend to kill, I was sentenced to more than two decades in state Prison and I remained there until January 14, 2014.
I did change as I matured.
Even though I was in prison, I disassociated myself from the negative peer influences of the prison gang culture and immersed myself into education and figuring out the positive factors that led to my delinquency and criminality through twelve step selfhelp programs.
In 2014, I was paroled from prison through temporary agencies.
I found work in local factories in Compton, California.
My first customer service job was at Walmart, and with a sincere desire to give back to my community, I became a member of the Antirecidivism coalition.
In 2012, I got married and now I have a two year old daughter.
My wife is pregnant with her second child on the way in June of this year.
I am now the assistant executive director of Jesuit Restorative Justice Initiative.
For the past two years, I have traveled to many California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation facilities on a bimonthly basis to give hope and motivations to thousands of inmates.
Last year, I designed a program for an organization called Footprints, which strives to transform the lives of incarcerated gang members by building supportive relationships and empowering them with the tools to recognize the negative reality of gang life and disassociate themselves from gang involvement.
I tried to give all the prisoners I encounter hope to tell them that there are more than their worst actions and encourage them to stay on the path of rehabilitation.
I have been approved by the CDCR to enter ten prisons, which is a rare privilege for a formally incarcerated man still on parole.
As a part of my work, I also met with survivors of crime and parents who have lost children to violence, who are working to forgive those who are so harmed them.
I do not advocate for SB 1437.
For myself, I have already spent over two decades in prison.
Instead, I am here for all those who are inside who did not commit murder, nor intended to commit murder, and yet who still remain incarcerated for murder.
I was granted parole in 2013.
Admiration of parole Hearing I can tell you that to receive a grant of parole, the commission the commissioners want a prisoner to accept responsibility for the crime of commitment, for accomplices, sentenced.
Other than Felony Murder Rule, this puts one in an almost impossible position.
A person must accept responsibility for a murder that one did not do nor ever intended to do.
I believe that people must be held accountable for their actions, but that punishment must be tied to one's intentions.
I urge you to vote yes on Senate Bill 1437.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, everyone.
And thank you, Senator Skinner, for having us here on this historical day in this historical building.
My name is Jacques Wilson and I'm a deputy public defender in San Francisco.
And this is my father, Mac Wilson, who is behind me here.
And Mac Wilson is retired from the United States Air Force, and he served two tours of duty in Vietnam with distinction.
The reason that we are here today is that my brother and my father's son, who's in the picture right here, is charged with Felony Murder.
And that is true even though he did not kill anyone, attempt to kill anyone, or intend to kill anyone.
He wasn't even present at the scene.
But none of that matters under the Felony Murder rule.
Under the Felony Murder Rule, a person can be sentenced to first degree murder even when they did not kill or intend to kill.
My family is not the only family that has been devastated by this antiquated practice.
The Felony Murder Rule has taken the heaviest toll on young people, women and people of color.
This toll can only be measured in heartbreak.
My 83 year old father's last wish is to be able to hug his son again.
My niece's wish is to be reunited with her father, who is not a killer.
To be clear, SB 1437 does not abolish the felony murder rule.
It merely limits its application to those who actually killed, intended to kill, or who were major participants and acted with reckless indifference.
SB 1437 is a rule of individual responsibility.
It is a bedrock principle of the law and of fairness that a person should be punished for his or her actions according to his or her own level of individual responsibility and not for the action of others.
Life sentences for non perpetrators of the fatal act not only fails to place blame squarely where it belongs, but it approaches cruel and unusual punishment.
SB 1437 allows for an individual assessment of a participant's culpability.
The average age of a person convicted under the Felony Murder Rule is 20.
Psychological research cited by the United States Supreme Court demonstrates that people continue to cognitively develop into their mid 20s before that time.
Young people have not fully developed the decision making skills to remove themselves from dangerous situations, particularly when older peers are involved.
Research has shown that the Felony Murder Rule does not deter crime and that 99.5% of people incarcerated for murder were not even aware that the rule existed before they committed their crimes.
It cost over $70,000 annually to incarcerate a person.
This bill would save taxpayers millions.
Further, as many lawyers who have litigated felony murder cases can tell you, in order to avoid the first degree murder charge for an accomplice, an effective lawyer will leave no stone unturned.
That means that cases are in trial courts for years prior to trial and this can cost the court and counties hundreds of thousands of dollars per defendant.
I want to reiterate the people who we are talking about that this bill would impact are not murderers despite the label.
They are our sons, our daughters, our community members, our friends.
Over 35 years ago, the California Supreme Court called the Felony Murder Rule barbaric and asked this legislature to end it.
You all have the power to make that change.
We now ask this legislature to heat this call and thank you very much.
