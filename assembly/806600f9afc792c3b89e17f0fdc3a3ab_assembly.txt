Bills out.
Thanks so much.
So now I'll go to SB 1437.
What SB 1437 does is address the fact that California's murder statute has not been modified for decades.
And we're, when it was adopted, it swept up the English common law concept of Felony Murder, which is, as I indicated, in a common law concept that is more than a century old, which basically does not so much hold.
The culpability.
Of the person at question, is less a factor in the charge for the crime.
And instead, anytime a crime that was committed where a death occurs, the Felony Murder Rule sweeps up any participant in that crime.
Now, what that in its practical effect has resulted in is that we have people in California who are serving life without parole sentences, who were convicted under the Felony Murder Rule, who were neither aware that a murder occurred, planned the murder, or committed the murder.
And while we still have on the books such laws as accessory to murder and accomplice to murder, we have the ability, through existing statutes, to capture those, what we might call participants in a crime and deal with their less culpability.
That does not have to apply a Felony Murder Rule to those who had a very minimal, if almost nonexistent, role in the crime.
So that is what this bill is tempting to do, is narrow that statute and narrow it in a way that patterns after the State of Ohio, the State of Kentucky, and a number of other states who similarly did this after court cases within their state and within the State of California.
Our own Supreme Court, our Superior Court, has described the application of California's Felony Murder Rule as barbaric, but has not changed the sentences and has indicated that it is the domain of the legislature to address this problem.
So that is why I bring the bill to before you today in order to address that problem.
And I would like my witnesses now to speak and witnesses and support to testify.
Thank you.
Having five minutes apiece.
Not each, but five minutes in total.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Good morning.
My name is Jacques Wilson, and this is my father, Mac Wilson.
He's a retired Air Force sergeant.
He served two tours of duty in Vietnam with distinction.
He is my hero.
He is my inspiration.
The reason that we are here is because my younger brother is charged with Felony Murder.
And this is true.
Even though he did not kill anyone, attempt to kill anyone, or intend to kill anyone.
He wasn't even present at the scene.
However, under the Felony Murder rule, none of that matters.
And to be clear, SB 1437 does not abolish the Felony Murder Rule.
It merely limits its application.
My family is not the only family which has been devastated by this antiquated practice.
The Felony Murder Rule has taken the heaviest toll on young people, women and people of color.
This toll can only be measured in heartbreak.
My 83 year old father's last wish is to be able to hug his son again.
My twelve year old niece only wish is to be reunited with her father.
It cost over $80,000 annually to incarcerate a person.
This bill would save taxpayers millions.
Further effective lawyers leave no stone unturned when litigating accomplice liability felony Murder cases.
That means that cases are in the trial court for years prior to trial.
This can cost the courts and counties hundreds of thousands of dollars per defendant.
The people we are talking about are not murderers, despite their label.
They are sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, friends and community members.
Over 35 years ago, the California Supreme Court called the Felony Murder Rule barbaric and asked this legislature to fix it.
You all have the power to make that change.
We ask that you make that change.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Good morning.
My name is Kate Chatfield and I'm the policy Director of Restored Justice.
SB 1437 is a rule of individual responsibility.
It is a bedrock principle of the law and of fairness that a person should be punished for his or her actions according to his or her own level of individual responsibility and not for the actions of another.
Life sentences for non perpetrators of the fatal act not only fails to place blame where it belongs, but it also approaches cruel and unusual punishment.
SB 1437 allows for an individualized assessment of a participant's culpability, something that is done throughout our criminal justice system, with the Felony Murder Rule being one glaring exception.
The average age of a person convicted under the Felony Murder Rule as a non perpetrator is 20 years old.
Psychological research cited by the United States Supreme Court demonstrates that people continue to cognitively develop into their mid 20s.
Before that time, young people have not fully developed the decision making skills to remove themselves from dangerous situations, particularly when older peers are involved.
Moreover, studies revealed that 72% of women incarcerated in California with a life sentence under the Felony Murder Rule were not the perpetrators of the homicide they were accomplices in the underlying crime only.
SB 1437 would also allow resentencing for people who did not kill or intend to kill.
Instead, these incarcerated Californians would be sentenced for the crimes they did commit and would no longer serve life sentences for crimes they did not commit, as outlined in this committee's analysis.
Research reveals there is no deterrent effect to the Felony Murder Rule as cited in the analysis.
If the primary rationale for a state to retain the Felony Murder Rule is to reduce crime, the state should reconsider this rule.
Public safety and just criminal laws are not a zero sum game.
The State of California can still protect public safety and have adjust an equitable criminal justice system.
I urge you to vote yes on SB 1437 today.
Thank you.
