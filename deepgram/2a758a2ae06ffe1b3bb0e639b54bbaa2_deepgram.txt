Good morning, mr Baron Members of the Committee. How are you? Good. Cathy Lynch representing the National Shooting Sports Foundation. We represent manufacturers and dealers and we're not opposition to this bill The industry is already very heavily regulated at both the federal and state level. California law does currently authorize inspections, so you don't need a bill to do that. The inspection cycle that would be mandated is actually detrimental to public safety because it doesn't allow for good inspection planning and if they know that there's troubled spots, It puts a strain on their resources. And it was suggested by the author staff that Doj wanted this bill. If that in fact is true, then that would suggest one of two things. One that this bill is really about raising revenue and increasing the cost of doing business by increasing fees and we should have an honest conversation. If that's what it's about, it would increase it from ninety five dollars to hundred and fifteen. A lot of these are small businesses. And... And otherwise, it would suggest that Doj needs a level of oversight in the firearms division that maybe we need to top down review if they can't manage on doing their inspections. We know they'd struggled might way with the arm prohibited persons program over the years and that's been a strain on their resources and I would suggest that perhaps we take a deeper look if they need to be toll powell and when to do inspections. Thank you. Thank you. Chairman members Sam is representing Gun on California. And our concern is over the provision of the the mandatory three year inspection of all dealers, we did the calculations and based on the number of dealers there are. And if they were The inspectors were to take a minimal amount of time to conduct inspections and we know that some dealers take literally weeks to do and some are accomplished in a very short period of time. It would take a staff of several trained inspectors, probably our estimates are somewhere between four and five years working three sixty five days a year in order to conduct those inspections. Right now, Doj has the authority to conduct as many inspections as often as they want to of any dealers and what we have seen is that they when they identify a troubled dealer that they inspect them regularly, if not more often than that. But for a lot of dealers who have proven throughout history, that their records are absolutely clean. They are they have earned the trust of the department of justice and and the inspectors. And Doj takes a little bit of longer in order to conduct in inspection. They still conduct the inspections. But if they were to find that there's an issue, then they conduct them more often. But this is gonna to put Doj into a box that is people do not understand what goes on in in an inspection. How do I know mister Chairman, as I pointed out here. I'm a licensed firearms dealer in the state of California, and I have had Doj and Bat inspections of my very small books and it is very time consuming. This is this is needless to accomplish any sort of law enforcement purpose. Everything happens in this law, we believe puts the Department of justice into a box that they don't need to be put into. For those reasons, gun orange California as opposed to this bill. Thank you. Thank you. Any other witnesses that opposition? Chairman members of the committee, craig Lose Path finance policy coalition. We like the previous versions bill, but unfortunately, with the with the requirements for the inspections we're going to have to oppose. Thank you Thank you. Mister Chairman, we're not opposed to any of the other provisions of the bell I neglected to say that. Thank you. Thank you for the clarification. Any questions from committee members? Yes, mister Kylie, and mr Lack. My concern is The burden that this is gonna place on Doj as considerable. I don't think anybody can argue that. And I've just learned that the allocation from budget of five, was denied conference. And so I have concerns over the priority and the actual implementation that is actually going to be able to be carried out, and that's my biggest skill. We have not received any pushback from Doj on this, I believe the three year framework came directly from them in the conversation with senate appropriation. And so we're not hearing from them that this is going to create a burden at all. So if that helps. K. Thank you. Good morning, senator. So I really wish these were two different bills because I I'm very supportive of the first part. On the second, do you have any sense of what the kind of existing frequency of inspections is and whether or not there are issues out there with licensed fire dealers that are not being identified because the inspections are not sufficiently frequent. Are I don't have the actual statistics, but we've panicked anecdotally been told that it's a problem that needs to be five and Doj is so this is the framework that has come out of that. So dealers are not being inspected. I mean, that's the bottom line. If they were, we wouldn't be bringing the bill forward. Was there a common to add from... Well I just said that a few years ago, we did a public record request on dealer violations just for the top five dealers in their violations, and I was rather astounded at how long the list was. So clearly the violations happen. Just wanna to make that point. And how do we know what violations aren't how if the inspections aren't happening. So the whole idea of focusing the effort a little difficult to do if you don't know where you need to focus. Second. Thank you, mr P Senator. A few things when I support this of concept and I have a few follow ups. But can you maybe I'm not regular on this committee sub today. So my understanding reading real quick is that the fee structure to address the issue of staffing department of justice is is addressed and the licensing fee would increase by twenty bucks roughly. And and we think that would cover right. The staffing issues at the Department of Justice. Right. Right. Again, this is not an exorbitant increase. It's not an exorbitant amount, but there's a lack of oversight and this solves that problem. And I don't think that's unreasonable, you know, many businesses and with with with lower public safety issues are inspected on a regular basis. Do you know often Californian specs nail Salons in California? I do not know, but I think I bet you'd know every year. And the dangers of Nail salons, one thing and the dangers which could go wrong, when somebody you know, theft and oversight and security and all kinds of issues issues with licensed gun dealers, are well documented. So I don't think this is an unreasonable issue and I think that there's a nexus here based upon what we have seen in California side support this measure. Thank you. Thank you. And you make close. No, I assembly member did a very good job. This is not onerous. This is needed and it the cost is not exorbitant and when we're dealing with public safety and we pride ourselves that we have great approaches to public safety and gun ownership. We should have inspections that our commensurate with what we've done in the past. So I respectfully the asked when I vote. And and I want to think my colleagues could basically you asked the questions that I had and you got the answers that satisfied to me that we need to go forward that and I also was with mister Lack and trying to get funding for Doj for a myriad to different things including cannabis and didn't move forward and we were very disappointed in that. The fact that there's a funding stream not coming from general fun, it helps a lot. The fact that Doj has not pushed back and so they couldn't do it. And that you actually... You know, this is my thing, I say over and over again, talk to the people who have to implement it. And then you put it into law. Right instead of the instead I was trying to force it on them. So knowing it was really important to know that when it went to senate that that question was proposed to Doj right. And they didn't fill in any problems with it. And then finally, the fact that nail can do it every year. We need to move this on with that call the rule. Sb p seven forty six the motion is due pass as amended to the Appropriation committee John Sawyer. Your Lack Not voting. Kylie, kylie no Quirk. Weber. Builds on call one more. Senator of Bell, Sb two five item number one. Whenever you're ready, senator
