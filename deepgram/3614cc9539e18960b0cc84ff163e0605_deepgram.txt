Go ahead center for Right. Thank you. Madam Chair members. Today, I'm presenting Eleven hundred, which prohibits any person from making an application to purchase more than one firearm within a thirty day period. The bill would also importantly prohibit the sale of any by licensed dealer to any person below the age of twenty one years old. In addition, because of the interaction of state and federal receivers or frames, the Gun minus the barrel are also applicable to the thirty day purchase period. While handgun are using in the majority of gun deaths, long guns have been used to many of the largest mass shootings in the U. S. History, including the recent tragic events that took place in San Bernardino, California. California is home to the most stringent gun laws in the country proudly. One example is requiring an individual to be twenty one years of age in order to purchase a handgun. Another is the general limitation on gun dealer delivery of one handgun to an individual in a thirty day period. Since these laws have taken effect, the data shows there have been a successful reduction in the incidence of gun trafficking while not burden legitimate gun owners or persons who wish to acquire guns. In order to be uniformly consistent, California should apply the thirty day delivery period and twenty one year age limit to long guns. Over the past ten years, Californian have typically purchased more long guns than handgun. Of the twenty six thousand six hundred and eighty two guns used in crimes that were entered into the California Department of justice automated firearm system database, eleven thousand five hundred were long guns. Preventing the flow of guns is important to public safety regardless of whether the firearm is a handgun or a long gun or purchase new from a dealer or through a private party transaction. Limiting firearm sales to one gun per month is a recognized strategy to reduce gun trafficking and keeping firearms out of dangerous hands. And on a personal note, just watching what happened in Florida, the parents and the rally cry of young people who have been engaged in this movement and driving all of us to do better out of respect for those young people in Florida, I would respectfully ask is committed to past this. And with me today. I have Amanda Wi cox from the California chapter of the Brady campaign to prevent gun violence on behalf of B eleven hundred. Thank you. Miss Brady may speak. I mean, miss Wi. Sorry. Yeah. It's early. Very early as husband refers to me as missus Brady, I was probably just going there. Again, amanda Wi cox on behalf of the twenty eight chapters, California chapters of the Brady campaign of prevent con violence. We are in support of Sb eleven hundred In general, our view is that handgun and long guns should be treated the same under California law and we've been slowly accomplishing that over the years. I think initially view that long guns are my grandfather Shotgun in the corner of the closet to deal with wildlife whatever. But now as we saw from here, the modern day sporting rifle is a high powered semi automatic that is just as lethal or more lethal been a handgun gun and sadly seemed to be the common weapon, the weapon of choice for some of these horrific mass shootings. And so clearly the laws to reduced violence with handgun should apply to long guns as well. In terms of raising the minimum age for long guns to twenty one, I I won't go over the all the statistics in my letter except to point out that individuals age eighteen to twenty compromise only forty excuse me, only four percent of the population, but commit seventeen percent of gun sides. So there's a disproportionate involvement of youth under age twenty one in gun violence. And know many youth are responsible many are not. And I think this is recognized in other areas. For example, someone under twenty one cannot rent a car, by alcohol, can't by handgun, it seems to be common sense that also applied to long guns. And then the other provision regarding capping the number of sales of long guns making it applied to off firearms to in a thirty day period. This is a policy that's been before you before. Twice to bill that we have sponsored. Again, if this is to match hand law, but I want you to be clear that the reason for this is it's an anti trafficking tool. When someone is buying thirty guns at once, it stands to reason that they're turning around and sell them in the black market. For a big profit. I also want to mention that this this provision will not impact most people Most long buyers about eighty two percent of long guns sold are sold with a single long in in a thirty day period. However, at the other end of the spectrum, we have individuals buying one hundred and seventy seven guns in one month. And digging into the specifics of that. They... When more guns are sold at one time, they tend to be lower receivers which are buildup up into military style weapons, legal or illegal ones and then sold on the black market. And that's that's clearly not in the interest of public safety of our state. So I urge you to support the spill. Thank you. Thank you. Do we have other witnesses and support, please come to the Mic? And I just wanted to notice people come that we have as probably you notice on the agenda a very long. A lot of bill's long agenda, we will be breaking at eleven thirty and whatever bills we've not concluded at eleven thirty will continue thereafter probably sometime, like one thirty, but we'll announce that at the time. So as expeditions as we can proceed with still properly vetting the bills, that's what my objective is. So go ahead witnesses in support. Rebecca gonzalez volunteer with the Brady campaign, Sacramento Valley chapter in support. Quick bay area student activists in support. Haven't changed you. Morning. Patty Shank from Los Angeles and Palm springs, I urge support in memory of all those who have lost their lives needlessly. Alright, Witness and witnesses in opposition. Two at the table and the others can speak at the just given their name and affiliation. I think chair members of the committee craig to lose on behalf of the firearms policy coalition Before I get started. Let me just say that I think the idea of two witnesses, two minutes. I didn't say two minutes and you may proceed. I never said two minutes. I've not put that But I will if you'd like me to. Then the then I do apologize. I'm just operating based on past practices of this committee. Oh, this committee has not used that timing. So please proceed or I will cut you off. Madam woman members of the committee. The challenge that we have with this bill is the basic elimination of a fundamental constitutional ride for a group of law abiding that individuals who we can send, we can hand a firearm to and send them across the world in order to defend our country, but will not allow them to defend themselves here at home in these United States. I wonder what you would say to a single mother at the age of twenty who is not able to defend so for her children should an invader or break into her home. The idea of re a specific group of people of once again of law abiding people simply based on a demographic. One can look. African American men are more likely this disproportionately to commit to commit firearm crimes yet. We wouldn't talk about eliminating their ability to be able to purchase the firearm. We would straw purchasers. Studies have shown the straw purchasers are more than likely to be female. Yet. We wouldn't talk about banning females from being able to purchase from being able to purchase certain firearms. Additionally, we would look at eighteen to twenty year olds are much more likely to cause traffic accidents. But I don't see anyone talking about banning eighteen to twenty one year old a twenty year olds from being able to purchase firearms. Additionally, the idea of rationing a constitutional en illuminated right is the same as saying well, you don't I don't know why we need more than one church in a community. It's also like saying, I don't know why you need to to have more than one book. The idea of rationing and constitutional en illuminated civil rights is a port. And if we treated any other constitutional right like this, This entire committee, this entire building would be livid. And the idea that we would do so, which such with such disregard for any process is sad and un unsupported by our constitution by the people of California you. And with this, we oppose this measure. Next witness. Madam Chair members of the committee for the Record Dan with National Rifle Association. We're here in strong opposition. This is a concept that we've explored in this committee before and the governor is previously veto out the gun rationing aspect as the author mentioned that California is home some of the strict is firearms laws in the country and we have laws that deal with trafficking of firearms and making sure that sales are only occasional. We have laws that already deal with all these concepts. And what we need to do is enforce them. And right now we have a huge backlog on our app system of actual prohibited persons that are in possession of firearms sitting out there and numbers more than ten thousand. I'd encourage we stop putting the impetus on the law abiding citizens and rationing their rights and taking away the rights of those that are eighteen to twenty years old and then instead focus on the criminal misuse of firearms rather than continue sold on the live abiding that we stand in opposition. Thank you. Thank you. Other witnesses in opposition. Members Representing Gun, California in strong opposition to this bill. Thank you. Morning madam to Kathy lynch representing the National shooting sports Foundation, the firearms industry ammunition manufacturers, outdoor sports Coalition of California, Spark club International, and California Sports since all strong opposition. Same Mc man, strong opposition and adam chair, I don't get it consent an eighteen year old to a foreign country risking her life to defend the constitution, when she returns, we deny her her right to exercise the right to defend herself back in this country. And that doesn't square A police officers is more likely to kill than a twenty one year old, you should regulate their arms. I'm not in support of this bill. Any other witnesses in opposition? Alright. Senator Port. If you would you like me to respond? No not well, I was gonna ask you clothes, but I would just note and maybe you were planning to that California has one of the lowest rates of gun violence deaths. Per capita of any state. And additionally that Florida just adopted the law to limit the age for a person to purchase a fire. And I could also... The question was or a statement was made that there's without a process. This is the process. Okay. So if Senator or Wiener Thank you, Chair. I want to thank Senator Po for introduce bill, and I'm proud to be a principal c author of it. And you know, the reality is that this this nation, we are just a awash in guns and we're never going to see a reduction in gun violence until we have fewer guns. In this country we talked about particularly guns who's really their reason for existence is to kill people and we have seen that over and over again and I am just so sick of the paralysis in this country as we have children getting killed in schools. And we know what we need to do to reduce his violence. It is not rocket science. We need to reduce the number of guns and the idea that that you can only buy one gun a month, why do you need to buy more than one gun a month? What possible rationale is there say, oh I I have a constitutional rate to buy more than one gun I'm not know you don't. And this is a good bill and I'm happy to support it. Senator Jackson. On the constitutional issue, you know there are no constitutional rights that are... Un. We require certain conditions the right of speech, for example. Time place and manner can be regulated. The notion that everybody has a right to own as many guns as they want is absolutely a fallacy. That's not in the constitution. And in fact, it wasn't in the constitution until about ten, twelve years ago with the Heller decision that allowed an un purchase of different types of firearms. We don't let people go out in by rocket launchers just because they want to. So I find that argument to be not only fall felicia, but I think it has emboldened people to expect that they can do whatever they want with firearms. And I think that does an enormous the service to the state and to the people of this country. And I'd also like to note that while one could argue perhaps sending people off war eighteen might not be a really good thing. But we have limits example, you're not supposed to be able to drink alcohol till you're twenty one, whether or not you fought for your country or not. We don't let people rent cars. Under the age of twenty five. So this whole notion about, oh, well, we we send people off to word at eighteen and therefore they should be able to come back and own guns. Just is inconsistent illogical. And I know we'll keep hearing the argument because it's it's red meat for some people. It's also false. And so with that, I would like to move this bill and be added as c author. Right seeing no other mics will have you close senator Port. Thank you, Madam, Chair. And I would like to compliment the chair as a c author, Mister Wiener is a principal c author assembly member Gibson who's been very passionate and about these issues on the assembly side. It's also principal assembly member, Gonzales fletcher and happy to have senator jackson. In watching the aftermath of Florida, there was a dad who was a victim, his child was taken. And he said shame on us in America if we become accepting of watching children die senseless. And to me as the father of sixteen year old who was actually in a lockdown at our mall two months ago where there was two shots fired and they locked down the Glendale Gall for couple hours and getting calls from other parents who had their children at the mall, we should never think of these things as acceptable common and normal and the statistics show that the proliferation of firearms is increasing to these incidence the disproportionate number of uses by teenagers. This bill is sound in its policy, it sound in its application. The statistics bear it out that it makes sense. And it's also sound in a valid response to what the young people in Florida are asking leaders to do and step up and make it safe for them to go to school to go to the mall to walk on main street. There are prudent exemptions in this bill. This is not just an emotional reaction. This is looking at hunting and law enforcement and military and trying to be principle than how we draft this legislation to approach that. So this is the appropriate place and process to have this conversation has been noted by the attorneys. We have the legal right to make these restrictions and we have the moral authority and we have the responsibility And with that, I respectfully asked for an vote. Right. The motion is due pass to appropriation. We'll take a roll call. Skinner, Ike in her I. Anderson? Who. Anderson, no. Bradford. Jackson. Hi. Jackson I Mitchell, Mitchell I stone, Stone no Wiener? Mean I.
