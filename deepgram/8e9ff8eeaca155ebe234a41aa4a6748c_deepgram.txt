And we will go to Mister Wood. The item eight, Ab nineteen nineteen. Whenever you're ready. Thank you, Madam Chair members. Late on the night of October eighth last year, wildfires raised through sonoma Napa and mend casino counties and lives were changed forever. His fires destroyed over eight thousand homes, including over three thousand in the city of Santa rosa alone. Thousands of my constituents lost their their homes in one night. This nightmare scenario took what was already a difficult housing market and turned it into a crisis. Current law prevents the cost of any good or service including housing from being raised more than ten percent during a declared disaster. Unfortunately, un landlords and Vacation Rental hosts have managed to skirt these protections and are now taking advantage of those who lost everything. In less than a week, the median rental rate in Sonoma county jumped by over thirty five percent and were dozens of examples of homes being offered for more than double the disaster price of similar homes. This happened because current law does not provide a method for determining the base rent of of a home that was not on the market before declared disaster. As a result, homeowners who have been who have a second home in the area have been able to put their house on the market at whatever price they deem they deem fit. With the loss of over five percent of the counties housing in stock, my district has become a prime hunting ground for landlords to take advantage of fire fire victims Ab nineteen nineteen closes the new rental loophole in existing law by by defining base rent as a hundred and sixty percent of the hud fair market price. This definition provides a clear defined number for both landlords and tenants to ensure everyone is playing by the rules. I'd like to thank the committee staff for their hard work on this bill. And respectfully request an I vote. Here to testify on behalf of the sonoma county district attorney is Matt C. Excellent. Go ahead. Afternoon. My name is Matt Sc. I'm a deputy attorney in the consumer protection unit of the Da office. Immediately after the fire our office at extensive outreach to get the word out about price gouging in the rental housing markets because we knew it was going to be an issue. And we did outreach both to the real estate industry and to the public and we've received hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of inquiries from landlords, tenants, property managers, realtors, you name it asking what they can and can't do under the statute. We've investigated close to two fifty complaints of price gouging in the rental housing area. And we think there are many more cases that were un reported because of fear of retaliation by landlords So far we've filed five criminal cases and we have many more cases that are still under review for either criminal or civil prosecution. Ph code section three ninety six currently lumps rental housing in with other consumer goods or services like bottled water, And what we've learned is that there are several unique issues in trying to apply three ninety six to the rental housing market. And what we need our clear standards for both the real estate industry and law enforcement. Ab nineteen nineteen would clarify certain aspects of Code section three ninety six as it applies to rental housing. And Extend three ninety six is reached to a couple situations that are not currently covered. With respect to the areas of clarification, the first is what I'll call insurance bidding. One of the most prevalent arguments that we've had is it wasn't price gouging because insurance companies came in and bid up the price or offered me more money. That's there's currently no defenses called for that allows for that in the statute. And it's created a lot of problems it affects the housing market in general, and it certainly affects those persons who are who are not insured, particularly renters and people who don't own their own homes. The next area, three ninety six currently has a defense for items that are on sale. If an item is on sale, after pre disaster post disaster, you can bring that in back up to its regular price plus ten percent, and we're seeking some clarification as to how that applies to rental housing. The next area three ninety six currently allows sellers of items to pass through certain increased costs that are imposed on them. And again, we're seeking eighty nineteen nineteen would clarify how that applies to rental housing. Next is the area of what I'll call furniture and ancillary goods. We found that there were some landlords that attempted to circumvent the statute by charging exorbitant rates for home furnishings, gardening, other services like that. So Ab nineteen nineteen would clarify what's allowed in that area and how much And then the last is the length of the rental term another frequent defense or argument that we heard was that landlord could raise the rent much higher because pre fire they were in a twelve month lease and fire they want they're limiting it to a three month lease. So it's a different product. So we'd like to see that area addressed. I'll turn down to the areas where three ninety six would be extended under the current bill, As the sibling member mentioned, Santa rosa the press Democrat ran of story, several weeks after the fires that according to Zillow, median rents in the County were up thirty six percent Zillow largely attributed that to new rentals on the market, properties that hadn't been rented pre fire that we're now coming on the market, fire and vacation rentals which are now being offered as more permanent housing. And three ninety six is not adequately address either of those areas. And so those landlords we're essentially allowed to charge whatever the market would bear. And as mentioned, that created some a lot of problems in some several high profile situations those were the types of situations that were in the paper. It skewed the market. It was up thirty six percent and it raised basic fairness issues, y one landlord on a particular street, could only charge three thousand dollars a month and someone down the street with essentially the same house charge nine thousand dollars a month under the same statute While we don't want to defer deter folks from making their rental homes available in times of crisis, we think Av nineteen nineteen would provide for a fair return to property owners that are not looking to take advantage of a disaster and that's through creating a clear standard, which would be a hundred and sixty percent of a fair market rate that's established by hud. Those rates are published on their website. They're easily attainable and and should provide clarity. And then the last issue we'd like to see addressed eviction. According to legal aid sonoma county saw twenty percent increase in eviction fire. Received dozens of complaints from people were evicted from their homes and then saw on Zillow or other areas that the home is now being offered rent at much higher rates than they were they were charging. And this creates two problems right now you have the price scheduling problem and you have new people that are on the market now because they were evicted unfairly. And so Ab nineteen nineteen would address that issue by providing special returns specifically for the eviction. Our office will respectfully request that you vote yes on the bill.

Thank you. Any witnesses in opposition? Right. Seeing none. We have any comment in the guy's of stone. Thank you. Again, Madam chair Dr. Wood. Thank you for bringing us forward startling to hear some of these statistics that went on it you know, I can't think of just about anything it could be as devastating as as losing your home and losing all your pictures and all your family member memorabilia and then to be taken advantage of and trying to maintain your life in a community while your life is being rebuilt. I mean this is a quality of life human issue. And I appreciate that you're bringing this forward. In your district sustain some significant mortality and devastation and we learn from these types of disasters and how we can better protect our constituents with the lessons that are learned and I applaud you for bringing this forward and I'm happy to move the bill appropriate time. Right. So we have a motion and if anything, I would say, the hundred and sixty percent is generous. It's an emergence and there were so many units that were lost and so I I feel I can support the bill. I would probably put it at a lower level of median just considering what the circumstances is and I probably would've extended the eviction protection for a few months after the state of emergency just given how we know how long it's gonna to take to replace those units, but I'm glad you're doing it. And if there's no other question will allow you to close. Just think thank you for the consideration. Is it is a crisis. It has affected so many people in so many ways, the loss of housing was meeting today with members of my community at the small business event and they have employees are being evicted on a regular basis and and it's very difficult. So this this housing shortage and these and these kinds of activities are affecting not only just the lives of those people, but businesses and our ability to recover and with that, I just respect the ask your. Right. We'll do a roll call. Motion is due passed to Geo, skinner, inner eye Anderson, Bradford Jackson, Mitchell. Mitchell i's stone, stone ai wiener.
