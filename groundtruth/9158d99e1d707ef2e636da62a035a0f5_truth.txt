All right, Senator Monning. That takes us to item number 13, SB 1129. Morning. Good morning Mr. Chair and members. I'd like to begin my accepting the Committee amendments. I'd like to especially thank you and Committee staff for your excellent work in helping to make this a better bill. So, in accepting the amendments, I want to thank you for working closely with our staff. Thank you Senator. Members, Senate bill 1126 will correct an injustice found in California's current family law codes where only certain survivors of domestic violence are protected from being forced to financially support their abusive spouse at the end of a marriage. Current law shields victims of attempted murder and victims of violence sexual felonies from having to pay their abusers spousal support,attorney's fees out of their separate property, or future income from interests in their pension or retirement. Survivors of all other forms of domestic violence however, cannot benefit from this important financial protection. Senate Bill 1129 addresses this inequity by expanding eligibility for these protections to all survivors of domestic violence, through a bifurcated systemthat provides guidance as to when the courts can award support to an abusive former spouse. If an abuser is convicted in the criminal court of felony domestic violence, meaning they are likely headed to prison for heinous acts against their spouse, the court will be prohibited from ordering financial support from the survivor. If an abuser is found guilty by a criminal court of misdemeanor of domestic violence,then the abuser will face a rebuttable presumption that they will not receive spousal support. Senate Bill 1129 maintains existing law that allows those survivors of abuse who fights back against their spouse and who is subsequently convicted of abuse themselves, to present this evidence of their history as a victim before a judge to in order to rebut the presumption. Finally, the Chair's amendments will further clarify that in instances of a misdemeanor conviction, the judge will have complete discretion in determining if the injured spouse is entitled to all or some their interest in the community property pension. Well, family law professionals have shared and will continue to share concerns about this bill. We feel we have crafted a balanced and thoughtful approach to protecting survivors that has received bipartisan support throughout the legislative process to date. Extending these protections to all victims, not only creates parity in the law, it will ensure that men and women who survive the insidious cycle of domestic abuse, are not re-victimized by having to support their abuser after they've succeeded in escaping the marriage. I want to thank you for this opportunity, respectfully ask your aye vote and Mr Chair, with your permission, I'd like to present one witness and if with the Chair permission, I have a short statement from the witness who because of her circumstance isn't able to appear publically. I have a short statement that I'd like to read with your permission from that victim, but I want to start by introducing our first witness. Good morning, I'm Laura Lee Martin, I'm part of a hidden demographic of domestic violence survivors, I'm hidden but not unique, I'm an educated woman who had a professional career, has earned a good income and who lives in nice house. On the outside everything look perfect but behind closed doors, domestic violence raged. I'm 64, I'm disabled, I have a rare heart condition, I'm on SSDI in a fixed pension. I care for an adult son, disable son who's suffered a brain injury in his high school graduation trip to Disney Land two years ago. I'm a survivor of domestic violence, I spend nearly 32 years. This bill hits close to home, but it won't benefit me. I was employed by the University of California 25 years, I started the science fellowship program in the Legislature, 10 years ago. In my professional life, I was confident and effective at home, I lived on eggshells. I feared for my life and the safety of my son. I would sleep in the ground floor guest room, so I could climb out of a window with the car backed in the driveway. I had a note in my safety deposit box that said if anything happened to me, it was my husband. Only after my son's brain injury,excuse me, did my son's safety outweigh my own fear of the financial loss. Current laws protect me from paying spousal support. Thank you, sorry, thought I had it together. They do not protect me from losing up to 50% of my pension and my retirement savings. I'm living on those monies. Those pension and retirement dollars, it is no different to me than providing him with spousal support. He gains, I lose, unless I stay married to him. If I'd stayed in this relationship until he tried to murder me, I wouldn't loose any retirement or pension income under state law. The line of luck between attempted murder and murder is too thin and unpredictable to be with this Legislature and intended to be the best to protect domestic violence victims. My husband played on my fair financial insecurity to keep me captive. His return of investment increased with years of abuse. This is not about fault, this not about denying a nice guy his share of community property earned during a marriage, it's about future financial reward for someone who extracted from the victim during the ongoing perpetration of a crime. A reward this victim, any victim will pay to the abuser for the rest of the victims life. It sort of moves into the line of elder abuse at that point. Financially, my husband will be rewarded, my son and I will struggle. This bill will also help remove the financial insecurity that holds many victims like it did me captive and it will send the message to abusers that there is a financial consequence for their abuse. It will help victims like me come out of the shadows. I'm still married to my husband. The financial consequences of leaving him were so dire given my age, my disability and my need to care for my son,I really don't know what to do. I have the options of civil court, The State of California chose to let him plea bargain down. I'd have to start all over in civil court because I can't carry that conviction forward. That was a decision of the State of California, I had no say on that. I urge you to vote positively for this. I thank Senator Monning for authoring this bill and I respect and thank all of you for your time. Thank you, Senator, you had a statement you wanted. Yes, thank you Mr. Chair and Members. Our second support of witness was a constituent of mine who would have liked to be here today but unfortunately he was first to leave the state and change her identity in order to fully escape her abusive spouse. With the permission of the chair which I have requested already just short except. Dear Committee Members, I'm writing in hopes that you will help victims of domestic violence,in a way that wasn't available to me. My case is complete. I consider myself lucky. However, I embarked on this journey to work with Senator Monning to change legislation, so that others would be protected from what I deemed an unethical loophole in California family law. I have nothing to personally gain by urging this legislative change. I'm a neurologist who trained at one of those Ivy League Ivory Tower institutions. I'm young, I have and had a good steady income, I had a respectable education and a knowledge base associated with identifying abuse and psychopathy, I was even on my psychiatric rotation at the number one psychiatric institution in the country when I married, however, none of these protected me. I entered into my marriage with no warning signs and the abuse was introduced in a slow,calculated way that led me to be both fearful and full of guilt and servitude all at the same time. I've since learned this is all apart of the victimization cycle. In the end, he nearly ended my life. Laying in wait with a shotgun under my bed after a heated strangling incident. I thought California was a progressive state, until I went through this experience. I do not believe the law's intended to financially benefit abusers,but I do think they were written at a time when it was assumed only women could be abused and only men could earn an income. The reality is, anyone is subject to abuse, no matter their means, status or gender. I truly hope you pass this bill. I'm afraid if you don't, it sends the message that in California, it literally pays to be an abusive spouse. Thank you for time, signed Jane Doe. Thank you, and with that, Mr. Chair, thank you.
